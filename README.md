# MRC Cropping Program

In Bioinformatics, a main task is to understand the exact atom positions of a protein. Currently a method known as Cryo-EM is used to freeze and image proteins with varying accuracy. Many times these Cryo-EM images are extremely large and difficult to work with. Therefore, we have designed a program that can intelligently chop the protein into smaller images.
